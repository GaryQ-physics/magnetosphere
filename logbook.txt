logbook


runs:

    SWPC:

        have plotted multiple files with cutplane_plot_demo2.py

        have plotted dB vs time at stations and matches SWMF file, with bs_compare_SWMF_kameleon

        


    SCARR5:




    SCARR1:



    CARR_IMPULSE:

        have plotted one file with cutplane_plot

    DIPTSUR2: (CARR_IMPULSE apears to be just one file from this)

        plotted all files and made the video animations with cutplane_plot_demo5.py and cutplane_plot_demo2_animate.py


Notes:

2020/09/03
    cutplane_plot_demo5 is like _demo2 but parallelizes by files. Tested with SWPC

2020/09/05
    moved location for calling cdflist.txt in util.get_available_slices from run_cdf to run_derived since no permission to write to run_cdf on sunspot

2020/09/06
    sunspot Permission denied to write to '/media/solar-backup/tmp/data/SCARR5' when config tries to mkdir SCARR5

2020/09/08
    despite sunspot and local being up to date with cutplane_plotting branch, got slightly different results for magnetometer location:

        working hypothesis: different versions of spacepy

2020/09/17
    new script quadrants.py
    ran quadrants.py for DIPTSUR2
    most up to date -derived folders now on sunspot /media/solar-backup/git-data/sblake
    full length anamations with cutplane_plot for DIPTSUR2, all variable, only xy plane though.
    earth surf numpy binary files now written to -derived
    DIPTSUR2 earth surf at 6:30

    made spacepy test script for issue in 2020/09/08:

    quadrants.py -> regions.py
    new subdirectory run-derived/regions/
    regions.py should replace bs_compare_SWMF_kameleon.py eventually
    ran regions for DIPTSUR2 (all files) on sunspot

2020/09/28
    cuplane_plot_demo2b.py now has zoomed in option (process_type=3)
    ran above for DIPTSUR2 without rerunning process_type=1,2

2020/10/16
    wrote compare_many_points.py


2020/10/17
    edited biot_savart.py: moved old deltaB() to deltaB_old(), then 
    \   vectorized deltaB() to allow multiple field evaluation points (X0 is (M,3)).
    \   Also made more memory efficient. Checked it agrees with deltaB_old() using
    \   the tripple quotes commented script at top of biot_savart.py
    wrote check_curl.py

2020/10/21:
    wrote dissection.py to take two intersecting (in particular a cube around the earth center and cube around point of evaluation in magnetosphere) and 
    \   and find side limits of equivalent union of disjoint rectangular prisms
    \   and using GetRegions() returns tuple of formated dictionaries as in regions.py
    \   doing run of points sean requested on sunspot

2020/10/22:
    ran on sunspot failed from bug in dissection.GetRegions, namely lower limit could be highter than upper
    fixed that bug, running again on sunspot

2020/10/22:
    sunspot ran worked for points sean requested for DIPSTUR2. I copied the resulting bs_results.txt to local drive

2020/10/26:
    ran many_point.py with same points for DIPSTUR2 with cut=True this time
    IMP10_RUN_SAMPLE/regions/0190902T070000 still out of date though

2020/10/26:
    ran same points for DIPSTUR2 with cut=True this time

2020/10/27:
    generalized naming convention for check_curl.py
    renamed TESTANALYTIC-derived/check_curl_cut_False.txt -> TESTANALYTIC-derived/regions/20190902T063000/including_currents_before_rCurrents/check_curl_method_biotsavart.txt acordingly
    running check_curl for DIPTSUR2 (with different methods)

TODO:

call vtk_export from magnetovis into magnetosphere to get magnetosphere to get its examples working


paraview contour surfaces for dB_north

check mag grid files for DIPSURE2 (compare)
    want plot of earth surf at 6:30 using :
        maggrid files
        surf_deltaB
        png on google drive


change TESTANALYTIC so shell is inside 1Re

test the -> loc rotation against something analytic

also --show-origin doesnt work on sunspot. TODO: check git verison

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
