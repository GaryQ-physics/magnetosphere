logbook


runs:

    SWPC:

        have plotted multiple files with cutplane_plot_demo2.py

        have plotted dB vs time at stations and matches SWMF file, with bs_compare_SWMF_kameleon

        


    SCARR5:




    SCARR1:



    CARR_IMPULSE:

        have plotted one file with cutplane_plot

    DIPTSUR2: (CARR_IMPULSE apears to be just one file from this)

        plotted all files and made the video animations with cutplane_plot_demo5.py and cutplane_plot_demo2_animate.py


Notes:

2020/09/03
    cutplane_plot_demo5 is like _demo2 but parallelizes by files. Tested with SWPC

2020/09/05
    moved location for calling cdflist.txt in util.get_available_slices from run_cdf to run_derived since no permission to write to run_cdf on sunspot

2020/09/06
    sunspot Permission denied to write to '/media/solar-backup/tmp/data/SCARR5' when config tries to mkdir SCARR5

2020/09/08
    despite sunspot and local being up to date with cutplane_plotting branch, got slightly different results for magnetometer location:

also --show-origin doesnt work on sunspot. TODO: check git verison

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
