runs:

    SWPC:
        have plotted multiple files with cutplane_plot_demo2.py
        have plotted dB vs time at stations and matches SWMF file, with bs_compare_SWMF_kameleon
    SCARR5:

    SCARR1:

    CARR_IMPULSE:
        have plotted one file with cutplane_plot
    DIPTSUR2: (CARR_IMPULSE apears to be just one file from this)
        plotted all files and made the video animations with cutplane_plot_demo5.py and cutplane_plot_demo2_animate.py
        magnetosphere/BATSRUS_derivatives_consistancyCheck.py

Notes:

2020/09/03
    cutplane_plot_demo5 is like _demo2 but parallelizes by files. Tested with SWPC

2020/09/05
    moved location for calling cdflist.txt in util.get_available_slices from run_cdf to run_derived since no permission to write to run_cdf on sunspot

2020/09/06
    sunspot Permission denied to write to '/media/solar-backup/tmp/data/SCARR5' when config tries to mkdir SCARR5

2020/09/08
    despite sunspot and local being up to date with cutplane_plotting branch, got slightly different results for magnetometer location:

2020/09/21
    quadrants.py -> regions.py
    new subdirectory run-derived/regions/
    regions.py should replace bs_compare_SWMF_kameleon.py eventually
    ran regions for DIPTSUR2 (all files) on sunspot

2020/09/28
    cuplane_plot_demo2b.py now has zoomed in option (process_type=3)
    ran above for DIPTSUR2 without rerunning process_type=1,2

2020/10/16
    wrote compare_many_points.py


2020/10/17
    edited biot_savart.py: moved old deltaB() to deltaB_old(), then 
    \   vectorized deltaB() to allow multiple field evaluation points (X0 is (M,3)).
    \   Also made more memory efficient. Checked it agrees with deltaB_old() using
    \   the tripple quotes commented script at top of biot_savart.py
    wrote check_curl.py

2020/10/21:
    wrote dissection.py to take two intersecting (in particular a cube around the earth center and cube around point of evaluation in magnetosphere)
    \   and find side limits of equivalent union of disjoint rectangular prisms
    \   and using GetRegions() returns tuple of formated dictionaries as in regions.py
    \   doing run of points sean requested on sunspot

2020/10/22:
    ran on sunspot failed from bug in dissection.GetRegions, namely lower limit could be highter than upper
    fixed that bug, running again on sunspot

2020/10/22:
    sunspot ran worked for points sean requested for DIPSTUR2. I copied the resulting bs_results.txt to local drive

2020/10/26:
    ran many_point.py with same points for DIPSTUR2 with cut=True this time
    IMP10_RUN_SAMPLE/regions/0190902T070000 still out of date though

2020/10/26:
    ran same points for DIPSTUR2 with cut=True this time

2020/10/27:
    generalized naming convention for check_curl.py
    renamed TESTANALYTIC-derived/check_curl_cut_False.txt -> TESTANALYTIC-derived/regions/20190902T063000/including_currents_before_rCurrents/check_curl_method_biotsavart.txt acordingly
    ran check_curl for DIPTSUR2 (with different methods, b1_batsrus, b_batsrus, and biotsavart)

2020/10/29:
    turns out that check_curl run for DIPTSUR2 was only the short list...
    made new list of points called full_points.txt (in ~/ for laptop and sunspot)
    running check curl for full_points DIPTSUR2 on sunspot


2020/11/04:
    randomly generate list of points from all native grid points based on distance to earth
    tried to run random points on sunspot many_points.py, but error in dissection.py
    MODIFIED: in dissection.py line 281 to 283 the 0 index changed to 1
              also (and this is what fixed it) added if lim[0] == lim[1] statement before appending region.
    ran random points again on sunspot. Worked.

2020/11/05:
    run derivatives.py using rand_generated_points

2020/11/10:
    ran many_points using points on xplus,xminus,yplus,yminus axes, and plotted with jupyter similar to random points

2020/11/11:
    change condition in regions np.max(np.abs(positive + negative - full_deltaB)) < 1e-8  (was 1e-9 before, but there were values wiht slighly more 1.06e-9 ect failing)

2020/11/12:
    wrote vtk/streamTracer_test based on https://gitlab.kitware.com/vtk/vtk/blob/32ae6c76b70c8da05cec8cabe3ccda8988388561/Filters/General/Testing/Python/streamTracer.py
    regions.py NEEDS TO BE CHECKED that its not broken after remomoving biot_savart_kameleon_interpolated_grid dependence
    NEED TO INCLUDE rmin


    installed pyvista
    demo'd in create_unstructured_grid.py and in misc/pyvista/ directory
    in misc/pyvista/structured_grid_from_unstructured_grid.py shows how to directly write unstructured grid vtk file that has connectivity
    \   to trace field lines. Uses pyvista and normal open(,'w'). Note pyvista exports to vtk DataFile version 5.1, instead 3.0 that we've been using.

2021/01/24:
    used read_tree.py and .tree file, along with global min maxes of the volume, to recreate the points (as a set) in the corresponding .out file
    this should be able to be used to provide the nessesary tree structure to the list of points in the .out file. (nope, turns out the order n^2 operation to reindex is too much)

2021/02/01:
    commited misc/vtk/streamline_from_datafile_demo.py which can read the julia vtu files and trace stream lines from them using only vtk python library
    it only works right now for "UseNewPipeline = False", which doesnt use the ".GetOutputPort()" that was being used earlier to get the streamlines from structured grid .vtk files.
    It should in theory be possible in a different way, the "new pipeline" https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/New_Pipeline
2021/02/23:
    after failing to use jitFORTRAN repeadedly in same run, 
        after extensive writing simpler test programs to find whats wrong
        I found it can be fixed by simply adding one line to
        the Fortran_Subroutine class (in compile method):
        reload(jitFORTRAN_exe)
2021/04/22:
    calling swmf_file_reader as separate package now, and not using the one in magnetosphere/swmf/ (to rem ove later)

also --show-origin doesnt work on sunspot. TODO: check git verison

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

Since Git 2.0, Git defaults to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)

The radial component of B1 on the ghost face is set as B1rGhost = B1rCoef*B1rTrue at the inner boundary. B1rCoef=-1 corresponds to a reflective boundary, while B1rCoef=1 is a floating (zero gradient) boundary. Any value between -1 and 1 is possible. Using floating condition, however, will not work well for strong storms, as there is no mechanism to restore the dipole after the storm. Reflective will recover the dipole, but it may result in some less stable behavior. The optimal value may be problem dependent. The default value corresponding to reflection is shown above.
