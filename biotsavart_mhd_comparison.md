3 scatterplots, one for each cartesian component of *B1sim*, where *B1sim* is 
the MhD magnetic field, not including the earth dipole. (i.e. "b1" in BATS-R-US) 

datapoints color coded based on *value*, where *value* is the absolute value of 
the corresponding component of *B1sim*

small includes only points with *value* < 100.
mid includes only points with 100 <= *value* <= 1000.
large includes only points with 1000 <= *value*.
