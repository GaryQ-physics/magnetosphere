document install spacepy to use for python 2.7

pip install with python2 gave the error:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29046326/spacepy-importerror-cannot-import-name-irbempylib

First need to install pip for python2:
go to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ and click link to download get-pip.py

note:
'''
which python2
prints:  /usr/bin/python2
'''

so then run:
'''
sudo mv Downloads/get-pip.py /usr/bin/
cd /usr/bin
python2 get-pip.py

prints: WARNING: The scripts pip, pip2, pip2.7, (ect) are installed in '/home/gary/.local/bin' 
        which is not on PATH. Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress
        this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
'''

for me, running:
'''
which pip
prints: /home/gary/anaconda3/bin/pip
'''
which is the python3 one. So need to use 'python2 -m pip' instead of just 'pip'

Next we need to install the dependencies for spacepy:
run:
'''
cd /home/gary/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
sudo apt-get install python-h5py
python2 -m pip install sphinx numpydoc
'''

Finally, need to install spacepy: 
Download zip folder from https://github.com/spacepy/spacepy
then run:
'''
cd /home/gary/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
unzip /home/gary/Downloads/spacepy-master.zip -d .
cd spacepy-master/
sudo python2 setup.py install

prints: setup produced the following warnings. Some functionality may be missing.
        Numpydoc and sphinx required to build documentation.
        Help will not be available.
